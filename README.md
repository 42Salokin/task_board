# Task Board

## Description

This is a taskboard application that allows inputting and organizing tasks. Using jQuery and Bootstrap, I took pre-written starter code and added functionality. When the 'Add Task' button is clicked, a modal pops up to allow a task title, description, and due to date to be put in. That input then displays as a card in the 'to do' column. The color of the card changes depending on whether the task due date is coming up or overdue. The cards are able to be dragged and placed in the other columns. 

I will be adding functionality to make it so that the tasks can be deleted, and stay in their previously assigned columns on resetting the page.

## Credits

I frequently used advice from other developers in my class and Stack Overflow, and the information at W3schools to assist me with putting functions, methods, and properties in proper working order.

I used jQuery and Bootstrap for much of the style and format
